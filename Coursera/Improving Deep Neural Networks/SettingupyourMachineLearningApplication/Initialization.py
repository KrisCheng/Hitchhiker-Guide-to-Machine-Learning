# # Initialization
# 
# Welcome to the first assignment of "Improving Deep Neural Networks". 
# 
# Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well chosen initialization method will help learning.  
# 
# If you completed the previous course of this specialization, you probably followed our instructions for weight initialization, and it has worked out so far. But how do you choose the initialization for a new neural network? In this notebook, you will see how different initializations lead to different results. 
# 
# A well chosen initialization can:
# - Speed up the convergence of gradient descent
# - Increase the odds of gradient descent converging to a lower training (and generalization) error 
# 
# To get started, run the following cell to load the packages and the planar dataset you will try to classify.

# load image dataset: blue/red dots in circles
train_X, train_Y, test_X, test_Y = load_dataset()


# You would like a classifier to separate the blue dots from the red dots.

# ## 1 - Neural Network model 

# You will use a 3-layer neural network (already implemented for you). Here are the initialization methods you will experiment with:  
# - *Zeros initialization* --  setting `initialization = "zeros"` in the input argument.
# - *Random initialization* -- setting `initialization = "random"` in the input argument. This initializes the weights to large random values.  
# - *He initialization* -- setting `initialization = "he"` in the input argument. This initializes the weights to random values scaled according to a paper by He et al., 2015. 
# 
# **Instructions**: Please quickly read over the code below, and run it. In the next part you will implement the three initialization methods that this `model()` calls.

# The model is predicting 0 for every example. 
# 
# In general, initializing all the weights to zero results in the network failing to break symmetry. This means that every neuron in each layer will learn the same thing, and you might as well be training a neural network with $n^{[l]}=1$ for every layer, and the network is no more powerful than a linear classifier such as logistic regression. 

# <font color='blue'>
# **What you should remember**:
# - The weights $W^{[l]}$ should be initialized randomly to break symmetry. 
# - It is however okay to initialize the biases $b^{[l]}$ to zeros. Symmetry is still broken so long as $W^{[l]}$ is initialized randomly. 
# 

# ## 3 - Random initialization
# 
# To break symmetry, lets intialize the weights randomly. Following random initialization, each neuron can then proceed to learn a different function of its inputs. In this exercise, you will see what happens if the weights are intialized randomly, but to very large values. 
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement the following function to initialize your weights to large random values (scaled by \*10) and your biases to zeros. Use `np.random.randn(..,..) * 10` for weights and `np.zeros((.., ..))` for biases. We are using a fixed `np.random.seed(..)` to make sure your "random" weights  match ours, so don't worry if running several times your code gives you always the same initial values for the parameters.

# **Observations**:
# - The cost starts very high. This is because with large random-valued weights, the last activation (sigmoid) outputs results that are very close to 0 or 1 for some examples, and when it gets that example wrong it incurs a very high loss for that example. Indeed, when $\log(a^{[3]}) = \log(0)$, the loss goes to infinity.
# - Poor initialization can lead to vanishing/exploding gradients, which also slows down the optimization algorithm. 
# - If you train this network longer you will see better results, but initializing with overly large random numbers slows down the optimization.
# 
# <font color='blue'>
# **In summary**:
# - Initializing weights to very large random values does not work well. 
# - Hopefully intializing with small random values does better. The important question is: how small should be these random values be? Lets find out in the next part! 

# ## 4 - He initialization
# 
# Finally, try "He Initialization"; this is named for the first author of He et al., 2015. (If you have heard of "Xavier initialization", this is similar except Xavier initialization uses a scaling factor for the weights $W^{[l]}$ of `sqrt(1./layers_dims[l-1])` where He initialization would use `sqrt(2./layers_dims[l-1])`.)
# 
# **Exercise**: Implement the following function to initialize your parameters with He initialization.
# 
# **Hint**: This function is similar to the previous `initialize_parameters_random(...)`. The only difference is that instead of multiplying `np.random.randn(..,..)` by 10, you will multiply it by $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\text{dimension of the previous layer}}}$, which is what He initialization recommends for layers with a ReLU activation.
